* `meanconfid`: compute mean including confidence bounds assuming normal distribution (or large sample size)
* `stdconfid`: compute standard deviation including confidence bounds assuming normal distribution

### Distribution tests
* `testhist`: test distribution base on histogram approach (occurrences within given bins)

### Plot data
* `histfit`: normed histogram superimposed by fitted distribution
* [Q-Q plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qâ€“Q_plot)
